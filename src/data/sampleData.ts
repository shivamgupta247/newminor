This approach helps maintain high levels of focus while preventing mental fatigue. Learn how to implement this technique effectively in your study routine. Choose a single task to focus on during each Pomodoro session. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes to recharge. Eliminate all distractions including phone notifications during your focused intervals. Track completed Pomodoros to measure productivity and identify peak performance times. Adjust interval lengths based on your personal focus capacity and subject complexity. The technique works best when combined with proper planning and task prioritization.",
