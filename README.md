## 🔑 Key Systems

### Adaptive Quiz System

The adaptive quiz system uses an Elo-inspired rating algorithm to dynamically adjust question difficulty based on student performance:

- **Rating Calculation**: Students start at 300 rating and progress through Low (100-299), Medium (300-599), and Best (600+) categories
- **Question Selection**: Questions are selected based on current category and performance
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed analytics track accuracy, time taken, and improvement over time
- **Multiple Exam Types**: Support for GATE, JEE, CAT, NEET, and UPSC with subject-specific question banks

### Gamification System

Comprehensive gamification features to enhance student engagement:

**Badges** (12 types):
- ⚡ Fast Learner - Complete 5 quizzes in a day
- 👑 Accuracy King/Queen - Achieve 90%+ accuracy
- 💯 Perfect Score - Get 100% in any quiz
- 🔥 Comeback Champ - Improve by 30%+ after low score
- 🌟 Streak Starter - Maintain 3-day streak
- 💪 Week Warrior - Maintain 7-day streak
- 🏆 Month Master - Maintain 30-day streak
- 🚀 Speed Demon - Complete quiz in under 5 minutes
- 📚 Dedicated Learner - Complete 50 quizzes total
- 📈 Category Climber - Progress from Low to Best category
- 🎯 Consistent Performer - Maintain 75%+ accuracy over 10 quizzes

2. **Cosine Similarity** - Calculates document vector angles
3. **TF-IDF** - Weighs term importance across documents
4. **Levenshtein Distance** - Character-level edit distance
5. **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)** - Finds matching sequences
6. **Semantic Similarity** - Meaning-based similarity detection

**Code-Specific Algorithms**:
1. **AST Analysis** - Analyzes code structure
2. **CFG Similarity** - Compares program logic flow
3. **Winnowing Fingerprinting** - Creates k-gram fingerprints
4. **Variable Renaming Detection** - Identifies renamed variables

**Features**:
- Assignment creation and management
- Support for text, code, PDF, and image submissions
- Automated flagging (≥60% similarity)
- Side-by-side comparison with highlighting
- Comprehensive PDF reports
- Independent from gamification system
